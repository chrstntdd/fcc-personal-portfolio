# fcc-personal-portfolio

Porting over the personal portfolio project I made for Free Code Camp.
Original can be found here on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/chrstntdd/full/yOZMRy/).

To-do list:
  + navbar
    + Responsiveness needs to be reimplemented.
    + Should be restyled with more functionality.
  + buttons
    + Custom CSS needed. Bootstrap buttons don't really fit.
